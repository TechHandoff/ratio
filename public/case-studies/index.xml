      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;out-of-the-storm-and-into-new-markets&#34;&gt;Out of the storm and into new markets&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearwater was evolving.

To establish itself as a leader in an expanded category, Clearwater needed a brand transformation that would sharpen its positioning, refine its messaging, and fuel its entry into the healthcare space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
