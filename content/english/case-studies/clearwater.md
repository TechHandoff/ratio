### Out of the storm and into new markets

Clearwater was evolving. After a key acquisition, the company set its sights on a new market, expanding beyond compliance into full-scale healthcare cybersecurity. But, its existing brand and digital strategy weren’t built for this next stage of growth. To establish itself as a leader in an expanded category, Clearwater needed a brand transformation that would sharpen its positioning, refine its messaging, and fuel its entry into the healthcare space.

We partnered with Clearwater to develop a bold, future-ready brand strategy — one that didn’t just reflect where the company had been, but where it was headed. The new identity clarified its value proposition, unified its full spectrum of services under a single, compelling narrative, and equipped the company with a digital presence designed to capture the market.

The impact was immediate. With a clear, differentiated market position, backed by a powerful digital strategy, Clearwater broke into the healthcare cybersecurity space and quickly solidified its leadership — setting the stage for sustained growth.
