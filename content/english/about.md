  block:
    - title: "Embrace Differences"
      content: "Ratio is a safe and respectful work community that values each individual’s background and identity. We believe the only way to foster a welcoming, dynamic, and powerful company is to embrace and intentionally expand diversity in perspective, thought, and opinion. Our growth and unified strength come from encouraging, accepting, and openness to learning from every unique person we encounter as we work."
    - title: "Candor"
      content: "Everyone in our company brings a unique perspective. There are no bad ideas. Open, sincere, honest, clear communication and feedback are requisite to ensure great work. We are not perfect and endeavor to surround communication with humility and kindness. We are free to communicate candidly and considerately, across all levels of our company, always."
    - title: "Right Thing, Right Way"
      content: "Temptations to compromise are ever-present. Shortcuts never work. We will always strive to do right by our fellow team members, clients, and vendors. We endeavor to ensure every member of our team is empowered to do their best work, and we maintain the belief that integrity and the resulting trust will ultimately enliven and propel our company."
    - title: "Work Smart"
      content: "We balance innovation and the drive to deliver at the highest level with the inherent constraints of time and budget. Thriving in that requires a smart approach. We know how we work best. We prioritize and focus on the highest value tasks and aim to simplify issues and solutions so everyone feels their time is valued and experiences the freedom to create and celebrate."
    - title: "Goal-Focused Collaboration"
      content: "Well-conceived and articulated goals provide clarity. Many possibilities and personalities surround our work. It is important to know and focus on the ultimate objectives, and then “play well with others” as we value and consider what each team member brings to the picture. We work together to create solutions that empathetically, pragmatically, and collaboratively hit that target."
    - title: "Lead Toward The Horizon"
      content: "It is our job to bring an innovative perspective, explore and understand market trends, determine direction, create solutions, and courageously lead our clients and our firm into the future. We may fail. That is okay. We will learn, grow, and continue to excel at building and proving value. “Forward” is our focus and taking initiative is a must — for everyone on our team."
